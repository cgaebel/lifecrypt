"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 43):
Clark and Elijah wrote this. As long as you retain this notice you can do
whatever you want with it. If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is
worth it, you can buy us a beer in return.

You can't use this if you're a member of law enforcement or the military.
